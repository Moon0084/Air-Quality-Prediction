# Air-Quality-Prediction
This study demonstrated that the ANN can be used to forecast air quality in cities such as Ahvaz in order to prevent health effects. They came to the conclusion that urban air quality authorities might evaluate the spatial-temporal profile of pollutants and air quality metrics using an artificial neural network.
